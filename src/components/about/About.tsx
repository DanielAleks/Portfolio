          I am a Self-taught Front-End Developer in Spokane, Washington. After being introduced to programming by my brother, I have come to love the world of code. I began my journey with simple HTML and CSS, slowly honing in my UI/UX skill. Soon I came across javascript, wanting to give up on this ridiculous dream. I persisted, learning how to use arrays, maps, loops, and other fancy javascript. Eventually, it got easier and I began having fun again. I became a developer.
          Programming has given me a second chance to make an impact on the world. Programming is my passion and a career I couldn't be happier to pursue.
